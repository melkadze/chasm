## Overview
### Description

Users upload a picture of a rock, and tag it with identifying variables like color 
(light or dark), luster (metallic or non metallic), and cleavage. From there, we pull, for instance,
the top 5 rocks that match those descriptions along with photos and additional info so they can identify it.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Science
- **Mobile:** We would have this app be mobile-first, and there is a good reason for this: support for taking pictures. This will not work as well on desktops/laptops, so we will leverage the benefits of having a mobile device.
- **Story:** Allows those who are interested in rocks to share their findings, and comment on those of others.
- **Market:** This app can cater to those who are well informed about rocks, as well as to those who are just getting started with a little bit of interest in the topic -- as our app will certainly grow that interest.
- **Habit:** The app can be used as often as the user utilizes their other social media apps, whether that be multiple times a day or a couple times a week. Since it has a scrollable feed that users can browse to catch up on all they've missed, there is no need to check it constantly.
- **Scope:** We would first start with creating an Instagram-like app, similar to the Parstagram app we've already built, and then add the categorization features which are specific to rocks. Later on, we will add other features that build on these such as identifying the rocks.
